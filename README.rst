1.19-prime branch
---------------------------

Xorg-kit is an overlay containing all core ebuilds related to xorg for Funtoo Linux. It is designed to exist on users
systems as an overlay, providing the ability for users to control what branch of xorg-kit they are using. It is designed
to be a part of the Funtoo Linux kits system.

The ``1.19-prime`` branch of xorg-kit is the initial, stable curated branch of xorg for Funtoo. By 'curated', we mean
that the overlay is a fork of a collection of ebuilds from Gentoo Linux that we have found particularly stable and will
be continuing to maintain.


The ``-prime`` suffix indicates that we consider this branch to be production-quality, enterprise class stability and
will be only incorporating bug fixes for specific issues and security backports. We will *not* be bumping versions of
ebuilds unless absolutely necessary and we have very strong belief that they will not negatively impact the
functionality on anyone's system.

Based on these policies, you should consider ``1.19-prime`` to be a reference implementation of xorg for Funtoo Linux
that you can rely on to be stable and perform consistently over an extended period of time.
